You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using this software. Your use of this software indicates
your acceptance of this license agreement and warranty. If you do not agree with the terms of this license, or if the terms of this
license contradict with your local laws, you must remove any files from the **IoT Gateway** from your storage devices and cease to use it. 
The terms of this license are subjects of changes in future versions of the **IoT Gateway**.

You may not use, copy, emulate, clone, rent, lease, sell, modify, decompile, disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or transfer the
licensed program, or any subset of the licensed program, except as provided for in this agreement.  Any such unauthorised use shall
result in immediate and automatic termination of this license and may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution.

The [source code](https://github.com/PeterWaher/IoTGateway) and libraries provided in this repository is provided open for the following uses:

* For **Personal evaluation**. Personal evaluation means evaluating the code, its libraries and underlying technologies, including learning 
	about underlying technologies.

* For **Academic use**. If you want to use the following code for academic use, all you need to do is to inform the author of who you are, 
	what academic institution you work for (or study for), and in what projects you intend to use the code. All that is asked in return is for 
	an acknowledgement and visible attribution to this repository, including a link, and that you do not redistribute the source code, or parts 
	thereof in the solutions you develop. If any solutions developed in an academic setting, become commercial, it will need a commercial license.

* For **Security analysis**. If you perform any security analysis on the code, to see what security aspects the code might have, all that is 
	asked of you, is that you inform the author of any findings at least forty-five days before publication of the findings, so that any vulnerabilities 
	might be addressed. Such contributions are much appreciated and will be acknowledged.

Commercial use of the code, in part or in full, in compiled binary form, or its source code, requires
a **Commercial License**. Contact the author for details.

**Note**: Distribution of code in source or compiled form, for purposes other than mentioned
above, is not considered personal use and requires a commercial license, even if distribution 
is made under an apparently free license. It facilitates the development of competing 
software, without the investment in actually performing the corresponding coding. It also 
can make the use of the original libraries obsolete, as free code apparently doing the same, 
based on the original libraries, would be available under an apparently free license. (Thus, 
making distribution free does not mitigate this effect.) Developers using the libraries to 
enhance their own projects (brands, offerings or businesses, even if the software itself is 
free), should therefore consider sponsoring the development of such software. It is the 
express intent of the developer of these libraries to create libraries that facilitate the 
development of great software for IoT. Also, the commercial license includes options to 
request customizations of the libraries.

Environment Variables
------------------------

During intial configuration and setup of the **IoT Gateway**, and any hosted services, a sequence of configuration steps have to be processed.
The operator of the Gateway, and hosted services, can choose to enter the information manually in each step via the web interface, or provide
the information via *environment variables*, allowing for the automation of the configuration and setup procedure.

### Web setup

The default method of configuring the **IoT Gateway** is via the web interface. The first time the gateway is run, the web interface is overridden
to display the configuration steps required to be completed. The user can choose a *simplified* or a *detailed* configuration. The *detailed*
configuration shows each step in the configuration process, while the *simplified* only shows required steps, while the others receive a *default*
configuration. As soon as all steps have been completed, the setup override is removed, and the gateway starts operating in a configured state.

### Automated setup

The setup procedure can be automated, by providing the values required for the setup in *Environment Variables*. This permits the operator
to automate the configuration, and to create containers with preprogrammed configurations. Available Environment Variables depends on the
amount of services hosted by the gateway. This repository contains a list of Environment Variables that can be used to automate the setup,
in the [Configuration Steps](ConfigurationSteps.md) article.

### Mixed setup

An operator can choose to partially pre-configure the gateway using only a subset of available *Environment Variables* necessary for a complete
configuration. During initial start of the gateway, the configuraiton steps with these preconfigured values will be skipped, as they will be seen
as completed. Only the configuration steps without preconfigured values will be shown.

Compiling solution
---------------------

You need to setup the build environment properly before you can compile the projects in this repository. The following subsections describe the configurations that need to be made:

### Instances

The IoT Gateway can be executed in multiple instances. The default instance uses the empty *instance name*. Each other instance, has a given instance name that is assigned to the executable via a command-line argument.  When building the IoT Gateway, it is assumed the instance name is `Dev`. This allows you to have a default installed version of the Gateway (or multiple installed instances), while your development version is running as a separate instance named `Dev` in parallel.

### Project Folders

Build events and script available in solutions assume the projects reside certain folders. On a Windows machine, the IoT Gateway repository is assumed to be cloned into the `C:\My Projects\IoTGateway` folder. On a MAC, that folder is assumed to be `/My Projects/IoT Gateway`.

#### Virtual root folders on MAC computers

To create a root folder on a MAC you need to create a virtual folder that appears in the root folder, due to restrictions in the operating system. To create the `/My Projects` folder, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal app.
2. Type `sudo nano /etc/synthetic.conf` and press Enter. You may need to enter your administrator password.
3. In the nano text editor, enter:
	
		My Projects	/Users/yourusername/My Projects
	
	There should be a space between `My` and `Projects`, but a TAB character between `My Projects` and `/Users...`. Also, replace the `yourusername` with the name of your user name.

4. Press Control + O to write the file, then Enter to confirm, and Control + X to exit nano.
5. Reboot your Mac.

After rebooting, you should see the virtual folder `/My Projects` in the root directory. 

### Windows

To compile projects on Windows, use Visual Studio 2022 (or later). The IoT Gateway separates executable and compiled code (which is later installed in any of the computer's Program Files folder(s)), and application data, which the application can read and write. The latter is stored in the corresponding `ProgramData` folder. The default installation of IoT Gateway, stores data in `C:\ProgramData\IoT Gateway`. A non-default instance, stores its application data in `C:\ProgramData\IoT Gateway INST`, where `INST` is replaced by the instance name. So before you can compile, you need to make sure the folder `C:\ProgramData\IoT Gateway Dev` exists, and that the user performing the build has access to this folder.

### MAC

The following sections list the preparations that need to be performed before you can compile and run the IoT Gateway on a MAC:

#### Application data folder

To compile projects on MAC, use VS Code for MAC. The IoT Gateway separates executable and compiled code (which is later installed in a computer's `/Applications` folder), and application data, which the application can read and write. The latter is stored in the corresponding `/usr/share` folder. The default installation of IoT Gateway, stores data in `/usr/share/IoT Gateway`. A non-default instance, stores its application data in `/usr/share/IoT Gateway INST`, where `INST` is replaced by the instance name. So before you can compile, you need to make sure the folder `/usr/share/IoT Gateway Dev` exists, and that the user performing the build has access to this folder.

**Note**: You might not be permitted to create a folder under `/usr/share` for security reasons, even if using `sudo`. In such cases, you can create a folder under `/usr/local/share` instead. This folder will be valid for development purposes. Once the gateway is placed in an installation package, the package tool will be able to create the proper share folder for you.

Terminal script to create and configure folder:

	sudo mkdir -p "/usr/share/IoT Gateway Dev"
	sudo chown yourusername "/usr/share/IoT Gateway Dev"
	sudo chmod 755 "/usr/share/IoT Gateway Dev"

In case you are not permitted to execute the above script, you can create a development folder instead:

	sudo mkdir -p "/usr/local/share/IoT Gateway Dev"
	sudo chown yourusername "/usr/local/share/IoT Gateway Dev"
	sudo chmod 755 "/usr/local/share/IoT Gateway Dev"

#### Database enryption

You also need to create an environment variable named `FILES_DB_SALT`. Since the MAC computer does not provide access to cryptographic resources, database encryption requires a salt that needs to be unique for each machine. The value can be anything, but cannot change, as it would render existing information unreadable.

To set an environment variable in mac OS, you can follow this procedure:

1.	Open the Terminal app.
2.	Edit the shell configuration file, such as ~/.bash_profile for Bash or ~/.zshrc for Zsh (the default shell in newer macOS versions), using a text editor like nano or vim:

		nano ~/.bash_profile

	or

		nano ~/.zshrc

3.	Add the export command to the end of the file:

		export FILES_DB_SALT="value"

	You need to replace the `value` with a random string you keep unique for the machine.

4.	Save the file and exit the editor.
5.	To apply the changes immediately, source the file:

		source ~/.bash_profile

	or

		source ~/.zshrc

	(You can also reboot the computer.)

### Running IoT Gateway

You have to have the correct .NET Core framework installed on your machine to run the gateway: [Download .NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0). 

When the gateway starts up, it reads the `gateway.config` file from the program data folder (see above) corresponding to the instance, if available. If not available, it reads the one provided in the build. This file contains information about what ports to open for different protocols, and any web folders to use. Review the file and its corresponding XML schema to get acquainted with options available. To modify this file, copy the file (if one does not exist) from the build output to the program data folder, and edit it there. Then restart the gateway.
