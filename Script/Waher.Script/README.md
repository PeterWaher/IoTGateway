Introduction
=============

The **Waher.Script** library contains a script parser and evaluation engine written in C#. The script engine is not ECMA-compliant. Instead, its focus
is to provide an efficient and compact script language using mathemathical notation.
It's part of the [IoTGateway solution](https://github.com/PeterWaher/IoTGateway).

For a reference of the script syntax, see <https://waher.se/Script.md>
