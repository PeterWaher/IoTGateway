Failed Dependency
=============================

The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code means that the method could
not be performed on the resource because the requested action
depended on another action and that action failed.  For example, if a
command in a PROPPATCH method fails, then, at minimum, the rest of
the commands will also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).
