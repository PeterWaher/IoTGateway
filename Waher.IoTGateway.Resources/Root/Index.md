Welcome to the IoT Gateway
=============================

The web server hosts any type of content under the `Root` folder. These are accessible directly from the root `/` in web applications. 
The `Graphics` folder contains graphics for different libraries that are included, such as Emojis from [Emoji One](http://emojione.com/), etc. 
The `Highlight` folder contains code from the [Syntax Highlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) project by Alex Gorbatchev.

You can publish content written directly in [Markdown](Markdown.md) under the `Root` folder, without preprocessing them or compiling them. 
Files with extensions `.md` or `.markdown` will be automatically converted to HTML if viewed by a browser. To retrieve the markdown file as-is, 
make sure the `HTTP GET` method includes `Accept: text/markdown` in its header.

You can make your markdown pages dynamic by the use of [Script](Script.md). Script allows you to perform calculations, draw graphs and access 
logic in your back-end applications, such as accessing databases, etc. The script engine is extensible, and is very easy to extend by modules
loaded by the web server. Check out the [Script reference](Script.md) page for more details. You can also use the [Calculator](Calculator.md)
to play around with script.

When the **IoT Gateway** runs, it loads all dynamic link modules (with file extension `.dll`) automatically. All extensions and executable
modules defined in these modules will be found and starated automatically.
